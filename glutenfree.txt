1 In a jar, soak the goji berries and raisins for at least

2 Invert a 1 ltr bowl onto greaseproof paper and draw
a disc around the rim. Do the same for a smaller
disc using a large drinking glass, then cut out the
discs. Grease the glass bowl with coconut oil and
stick the smaller disc to the bottom of the bowl
3 Fill a large saucepan halfway with water and place
an upturned saucer on the bottom. Bring the water
to the boil. Soak the chia seeds in the water.
4 Blend together the wet ingredients. Stir the chia
seed gel into the wet ingredients.
5 Mix together all of the dry ingredients, then stir in
the wet ingredients. Stir through the boozy raisins
and goji berries.
6 Spoon the batter into the glass bowl and smooth
down the top using the back of a spoon. Top with
the large greaseproof disc. Cover with tinfoil and
tie down tightly with string. Gently place the glass
bowl in the saucepan onto the upturned saucer.
Turn the stove down to low. Cover and simmer for
3 hours. Remove from the water and allow to cool.
7 Using a knife, gently run the blade around the edge
of the pudding, then turn onto an upturned plate.
Don’t shake it, just leave it to fall out gently. Dust
with icing sugar before serving.
* Use regular raisins and add to the soaking mixture
if you cannot find these chocolate ones.
